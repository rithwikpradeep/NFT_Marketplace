Additionally, users can utilize the Crypto Custody Wallet service to store and manage Cryptos.</p>

  <p>Crypto Custody Wallet: Satofin provides a Crypto Custody Wallet service that enables users to store and manage their Cryptos. The Cryptos held in the Crypto Custody Wallet are under the user's ownership and control. Satofin provides details of purchased and sold Cryptos in the User's Account.</p>
